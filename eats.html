    <h1>One of Jamaicas most celebrated historical landmarks The Devon House Mansion is the architectural dream of Jamaicas first black millionaire George Stiebel. 
    Stiebel was among three wealthy Jamaicans who constructed elaborate homes during the late 19th century at the corner of Trafalgar Road and Hope Road, which fittingly became known as the Millionaires Corner. 
    Daniel Finzi and the Verleys were the other families that resided in the area, however, both homes were eventually demolished to make way for development ventures including the construction of Abbey Court Apartments. 
    Stiebels legacy lives on with the beautifully maintained Devon House, which was declared a national monument in 1990 by the Jamaica National Heritage Trust.
    Today Devon house has THE best ice cream and pastrys on the island, as they make all pastrys in a brick oven. The grounds are used for various social functions
