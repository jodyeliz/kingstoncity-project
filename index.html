    <h2> Kingston was founded in July 22, 1692, as a refugee for survivors of an earthquake that destroyed Port Royal the town is sited across the harbor. 
    Before the earthquake, Kingstons functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a refugee camp on the sea front.  Two thousand people died due to mosquito borne diseases.
    The government sold land to people with the regulation that they would purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. 
    Riots in the 1930s lead to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers. 
    It wasnt till the 1960s that major change occurred in the redevelopment of the Kingston central business district.  The international attention of reggae music at that time, coincided with the expansion and development of the water front area. 
    Various organizations such as The Kingston Restoration Company
    and the Port Authority of Jamaica, along with the Port Royal Dev. Company, among others seek to develop the urban structure of the city.
